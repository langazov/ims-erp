    }
    
    // Run Tesseract
    result, err := tesseract.Recognize(img, s.languages)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    // Post-process results
    return &OCRResult{
        Text:      result.Text,
        Confidence: result.Confidence,
        Words:     result.Words,
    }, nil
}
```

    switch docType {
    case DocTypeInvoice:
        metadata.InvoiceNumber = e.extractInvoiceNumber(text)
        metadata.InvoiceDate = e.extractInvoiceDate(text)
        metadata.TotalAmount = e.extractTotalAmount(text)
        metadata.VendorName = e.extractVendorName(text)
    case DocTypeReceipt:
        metadata.TotalAmount = e.extractTotalAmount(text)
        metadata.Dates = e.extractAllDates(text)
    }

## Phase 6: Scale & Optimization (Months 13-15)

### 6.1 Performance Optimization (Week 65-70)

#### 6.1.1 Caching Strategy
- Implement write-through caching for frequently written data
- Add cache warming for hot data
- Implement cache compression for large objects
- Use Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling
- Implement cache sharding by tenant

#### 6.1.2 Database Optimization
```javascript
// MongoDB indexes optimization
db.client_events.createIndex({ 
    "metadata.tenantId": 1, 
    "eventType": 1, 
    "metadata.timestamp": -1 
})

db.invoices_read.createIndex({ 
    "tenantId": 1, 
    "status": 1, 
    "clientId": 1 
})

// Aggregation pipeline optimization
db.invoices_read.aggregate([
